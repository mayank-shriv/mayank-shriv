# Mayank Shrivastava  
**MCA Student | Full-Stack Development Learner | Python & SQL**

I am an MCA student focused on becoming a **job-ready Full-Stack Developer**. I work with **JavaScript, Python, and SQL** and I am building a strong foundation in **backend systems, databases, and problem-solving**.

Alongside web development, I have hands-on exposure to **Machine Learning fundamentals** and have built small **ML-based projects** for learning and experimentation.

I value **clear communication, structured thinking, and practical implementation** — not just theory.
